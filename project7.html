								<p>The most successful companies today are the one's who know their customers so well that they are able to anticipate their needs beforehand. This can better be achieved if we can segment the customers into different groups that reflect the similarities among the customers in each group. The goal of the segmentation is to foresee the needs of customers, get to know their interests, lifestyles, priorities and learn their spending habits so that to maximize the value of customers to the business. Customer segmentation has many advantages for the businesses which include:
								<li><b>Price Optimization:</b> Understanding the customers and their financial status will help to pace up with price optimization.</li>
								<li><b>Enhanced Competitiveness:</b> More the customer attention and more will be the revenue generated and this would in return enhances company competitiveness in the market. If the company can segment the market, it is well known to the customers and the company can come up with new products and optimize the existing products according to the changing preferences of the customers.</li>
								<li><b>Acquisition and Retention:</b> A personalized connection with the customers helps a company to win satisfied customers. Better segmentation of the customers will lead to better relationships with the prospective customers. About 75% of satisfied customers are more likely to stay with a company.</li>
								<li><b>Increased Revenues:</b> By fine tuning the marketing strategies will help generate more revenues because users will more likely to purchase when they are delivered exactly what they need. Personalized and segmented Emails increase the liklihood that more Emails will be opened. Infact the more Emails are opened, the more sales will be made. Successful marketing not only require knowledge about who your customers are but also where exactly they are in the buying process and customer segmentation based on such information ensure that the marketing campaigns are truly effective.</li>
								</p>
								<p>For the given Dataset, I will perform the exploratory data analysis with the help of customer segmentation. Customer segmentation will be carried out with the help of K-Means alogorithm. At the end of analysis I would like to answer some questions by gaining some insights from the data, which are as follows:
									<li><b>What are the statistical characteristics of the customers?</b></li>
									<li><b>What are the spending habits of the customers?</b></li>
									<li><b>Are there some products which need more marketing?</b></li>
									<li><b>How the marketing can be made effective?</b></li>
								</p>

								<h2>Import Package and Data</h2>
								<p>Started with imports of some basic libraries that are needed throughout the case. This includes Pandas and Numpy for data handling and processing as well as Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.</p>
								<pre><code>import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os

import plotly.express as px

%matplotlib inline
</code></pre>

								<p>For this exercise, the data set (.csv format) is downloaded to a local folder, read into the Jupyter notebook and stored in a Pandas DataFrame.</p>
								<pre><code>customer = pd.read_csv('C:\My Files\Document\Coding\Datasheet\marketing_campaign.csv', sep='\t')
</code></pre>
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/1.JPG" width="900" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>
								<h2>Data Preparation</h2></p>					
								<p>Get statistical information on numerical features.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/project7image/2.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>		
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/3.JPG" width = "900" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>
								<h3>Handle Missing Value</h3>
								<p>Lets check the missing value from the predictor.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/4.JPG" width = "200" height= "400" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>									
								<p>The Income column has some missing data. Let's drop the rows in the data with missing values.</p>
								<h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
								<p>There is a lot of information given in the dataset related to the customers. In some cases we can group some columns together to create new features and in some cases we can create new columns based on the existing one's to create new features. This would help to better explore the data and draw meaningful insights from it.</p>
								<h3>Age of Customers</h3>
								<p>Let's calculate the age of every customer from the birth year of customers. Since the customers enrollment with the company between 2012 and 2014, so we assume that the data was collected in January 2015 for the sake of simplicity.</p>
								<pre><code>import datetime as dt
customer['Age'] = 2015 - customer.Year_Birth
</code></pre>
								<h3>Months Since Enrollment</h3>
								<p>From the enrollment date of customers, let's calculate the number of months the customers are affiliated with the company.</p>
								<pre><code>customer['Dt_Customer'] = pd.to_datetime(customer['Dt_Customer'])
customer['Month_Customer'] = 12.0 * (2015 - customer.Dt_Customer.dt.year ) + (1 - customer.Dt_Customer.dt.month)
</code></pre>
								<h3>Total Spendings</h3>
								<p>The customer's spendings are given separately for different products. Let's sum them up to calculate the total spendings of the customers.</p>
								<pre><code>customer['TotalSpendings'] =  customer.MntWines + customer.MntFruits + customer.MntMeatProducts + customer.MntFishProducts + customer.MntSweetProducts + customer.MntGoldProds
</code></pre>
								<h3>Age Groups</h3>
								<p>On the basis of Age let's divide the customers into different age groups.</p>
								<pre><code>customer.loc[(customer['Age'] >= 13) & (customer['Age'] <= 19), 'AgeGroup'] = 'Teen'
customer.loc[(customer['Age'] >= 20) & (customer['Age']<= 39), 'AgeGroup'] = 'Adult'
customer.loc[(customer['Age'] >= 40) & (customer['Age'] <= 59), 'AgeGroup'] = 'Middle Age Adult'
customer.loc[(customer['Age'] > 60), 'AgeGroup'] = 'Senior Adult'
</code></pre>
								<h3>Number of Children</h3>
								<p>Informationis given separately for kids and teens at home for every customers. Let's sum them up, as they can be better represented together as the number of children at home.</p>
								<pre><code>customer['Children'] = customer['Kidhome'] + customer['Teenhome']
</code></pre>
								<h3>Marital Status</h3>
								<p>The Marital Status column has different string values: Together, Married, Divorced, Widow, Alone, Absurd, YOLO. Most of them fall under the same category. So let's represent the marital status of customers based on 2 main categories i.e. Partner and Single.</p>
								<pre><code>customer.Marital_Status = customer.Marital_Status.replace({'Together': 'Partner',
                                                           'Married': 'Partner',
                                                           'Divorced': 'Single',
                                                           'Widow': 'Single', 
                                                           'Alone': 'Single',
                                                           'Absurd': 'Single',
                                                           'YOLO': 'Single'})
</code></pre>
								<h3>Removing Outliers</h3>
								<p>There seems to be some outliers in the Age and Income columns. Let's check them.</p>
								<pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
sns.boxplot(y=customer.Age);
plt.ylabel('Age', fontsize=20, labelpad=20);
</code></pre>
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/5.png" width = "200" height= "300" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
										<pre><code>plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
sns.boxplot(y=customer.Income);
plt.ylabel('Income', fontsize=20, labelpad=20);
</code></pre>
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/6.png" width = "200" height= "300" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>
								<p>There are some customers aged above 100. This is unlikely to happen. Let's drop those customers from data.</p>
								<p>There are some customers who are earning more than 120,000 and some of them even more than 600,000. They are clearly the outliers in the data, so we will leave them out.</p>

								<h2>Machine Learning Model</h2>
								<p>Let's find out the different segmenst of the customers based on different features of the customers data using the K-Means Clusters. Let's first drop the unnecessary columns from the data.</p>
								<h3>Optimum Clusters Using Elbow Method</h3>
								<p>Let's choose the optimum number of clusters based on the Elbow method.</p>
								<div class="box alt">
										<div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-4"><span class="image"><img src="images/project7image/19.png" width = "500" height= "300" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
								</div>
								<p>Based on the above plot we will segment the customers into 4 clusters, as the inertia value donot decrase much after 4 clusters.</p>
								<h3>Clusters Identification</h3>
								<p>Let's try to identify the modelled 4 clusters from different features of the data</p>
								<div class="box alt">

										</div>
								</div>
								<h3>Clusters Interpretation</h3>
								<p>From the above analysis we can segment the customers into 4 groups based on their income and total spendings:
									<li><b>Platinum:</b> The one's with highest earnings and highest spendings.</li>
									<li><b>Gold:</b> The one's with high earnings and high spendings.</li>
									<li><b>Silver:</b> The one's having low salary and less spendings.</li>
									<li><b>Bronze:</b> The one's having lowest salary and least spendings.</li></p>
								<h3>Data Exploration: Clusters Based</h3>
								<p>Let's explore the data again based on the modelled clusters to identify the spending habits of the customers</p>
								<pre><code>customer_kmeans.clusters = customer_kmeans.clusters.replace({1: 'Bronze',
                                                             2: 'Platinum',
                                                             3: 'Silver',
                                                             0: 'Gold'})
